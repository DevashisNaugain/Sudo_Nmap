# Sudo_Nmap
Sudo_Nmap is an port scanning tool i am creating for understanding the whole concept that how nmap scans ports by simply creating a python port scanner.

In today's interconnected world, understanding the security posture of your network is crucial. One tool that has become synonymous with network scanning is Nmap. In this blog post, we will explore how Nmap works and delve into the fascinating world of building a network scanner tool using Python. So, put on your coding hat and get ready to unlock the secrets of network scanning!

Understanding Nmap:
Nmap, short for "Network Mapper," is an open-source tool used for network exploration and security auditing. It allows you to discover hosts, services, and vulnerabilities on a network by sending specially crafted packets and analyzing the responses. Nmap boasts an impressive set of features, including host discovery, port scanning, OS detection, version detection, and more.

How Nmap Works:
Nmap leverages a variety of scanning techniques to gather information about a target network. Let's take a closer look at some of the key techniques employed by Nmap:

1. Host Discovery:
Before scanning for open ports and services, Nmap needs to identify the live hosts on a network. It achieves this by sending ICMP echo requests (ping) and analyzing the responses. Additionally, it can employ techniques like ARP requests, TCP SYN scans, and UDP probes to determine if a host is active.

2. Port Scanning:
Once live hosts are identified, Nmap proceeds to scan for open ports and services. It employs different scanning techniques like TCP SYN scans (half-open scans), TCP connect scans (full-open scans), UDP scans, and more. Each technique has its strengths and weaknesses, allowing Nmap to adapt to various network configurations and evasion techniques.

3. Service and Version Detection:
Nmap goes beyond port scanning and attempts to determine the version and type of services running on open ports. It achieves this by sending specific probes to each open port and analyzing the responses. This information can be invaluable when assessing the security posture of a target network.

For this tool we will add all these functionality and explore how can be efficient and effective with network scanning.
